Papersizes
==========

Papersizes contains
constants and methods representing the sizes of standard papers around
the world. It is intended to be used for any output rendering / printing
or PDF generation task. The main content is in the
:mod:`papersizes` module.

It uses postscript points (defined as 1/72 inch) as its standard units,
because this is the standard unit for PDF files. The
:mod:`units` module contains other units and conversions.
